1. What is an API?
---> Definition: Application Programming Interface. A set of rules that allows two software applications to communicate.
The Intermediary: It acts as a messenger that takes a request from a Client (e.g., your mobile app) to a Server and brings the response back.
Analogy: A waiter in a restaurant. You (Client) give the order to the waiter (API), who tells the kitchen (Server) what to cook and brings the food back to you.

2. What is API Testing?
---> Target Layer: Focuses on the Business Logic layer of the software (the layer between the UI and the Database).
Why test it? * Speed: Tests run much faster than UI/Selenium tests.
Stability: APIs change less frequently than the visual interface.
Early Testing: You can test the backend before the frontend is even built.
What is verified?
HTTP Status Codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).
Response Body (Ensuring the data is correct).
Performance & Security (How fast is it? Is it protected?).

3. REST API (The Standard)
---> Full Form: REpresentational State Transfer.
Core Logic: It is "Stateless," meaning each request must contain all the information needed to understand and process it.
Data Format: Primarily uses JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) because it is lightweight and easy to read.
Standard HTTP Methods (CRUD):
GET: Retrieve data (Read).
POST: Create new data (Create).
PUT/PATCH: Update existing data (Update).
DELETE: Remove data (Delete).

4. Key Components of a Request
---> Endpoint (URL): The specific address of the resource (e.g., /api/users).
Method: The action to be performed (GET, POST, etc.).
Headers: Extra metadata (e.g., Content-Type: application/json or Authorization tokens).
Body (Payload): The data being sent to the server (used in POST/PUT).
