How is API Testing Done? (The Step-by-Step Process)
A. Prepare the Request
1. Endpoint (URL): The specific address where the API lives (e.g., https://api.example.com/v1/users).
2. HTTP Method: Decide what action to take (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
3. Headers: Include metadata like Content-Type: application/json or Authorization: Bearer <token>.
4. Payload (Body): For POST or PUT, provide the data you want to send, usually in JSON format.

B. Execute and Analyze the Response
1. Status Code: Verify if the server replied with the correct code (e.g., 200 OK for success, 201 Created for a new resource).
2. Response Body: Check the JSON data returned to ensure the fields and values are correct.
3. Response Headers: Verify security headers or cookies.
4. Performance: Ensure the API responded within an acceptable timeframe (e.g., under 500ms).

Key Status Codes to Know
Range      Meaning      Example    
2xx        Success        200 OK, 201 Created
3xx        Redirection    301 Moved Permanently
4xx        Client Error   400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found
5xx        Server Error   500 Internal Server Error, 503 Service Unavailable5. 

Tools of the Trade
Manual Testing: Postman or Insomnia.
Automation (Java): RestAssured.
Performance: JMeter or K6.

Common API Test Types
Functional Testing: Does the API do what it’s supposed to? (e.g., can I create a user?).
Negative Testing: What happens if I send a wrong password or a malformed JSON?
Security Testing: Can I access someone else's data without a token?
Load Testing: How many requests can the API handle before it crashes?
