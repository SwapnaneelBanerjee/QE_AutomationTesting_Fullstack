How is API Testing Done? (The Step-by-Step Process)
A. Prepare the RequestEndpoint (URL): The specific address where the API lives (e.g., https://api.example.com/v1/users).HTTP Method: Decide what action to take (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).Headers: Include metadata like Content-Type: application/json or Authorization: Bearer <token>.Payload (Body): For POST or PUT, provide the data you want to send, usually in JSON format.B. Execute and Analyze the ResponseStatus Code: Verify if the server replied with the correct code (e.g., 200 OK for success, 201 Created for a new resource).Response Body: Check the JSON data returned to ensure the fields and values are correct.Response Headers: Verify security headers or cookies.Performance: Ensure the API responded within an acceptable timeframe (e.g., under 500ms).

Common API Test Types
Functional Testing: Does the API do what it’s supposed to? (e.g., can I create a user?).
Negative Testing: What happens if I send a wrong password or a malformed JSON?
Security Testing: Can I access someone else's data without a token?
Load Testing: How many requests can the API handle before it crashes?
